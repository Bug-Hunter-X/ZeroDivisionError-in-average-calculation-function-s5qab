# ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation
This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError that can occur when calculating the average of an empty list.
The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, which fails to handle the case where the input list is empty.
The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles this edge case, preventing the error.
